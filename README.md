# Deep reinforcement learning tic-tac-toe

This project contains 2 components:

 - tictactoe.py: An openai gym environment for the game tic-tac-toe
 - experiment.py: A deep reinforcement learning implementation to create an agent on the game of tic-tac-toe.

Shortcomings:

 - There's a mistake in the setup: rewards for the opposing player are not counted as negative rewards. This needs to be fixed
