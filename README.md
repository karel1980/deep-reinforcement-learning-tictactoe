# Deep reinforcement learning tic-tac-toe

This project contains 2 components:

 - tictactoe.py: An openai gym environment for the game tic-tac-toe
 - experiment.py: A deep reinforcement learning implementation to create an agent on the game of tic-tac-toe. Keras is used for the agent's model, but no libraries are used for the deep reinforcement learningp part.

TODO:

 - Figure out why agents are not learning about valid moves & figure out why the 2nd agent always wins
